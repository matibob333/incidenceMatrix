## About The Project

The purpose of the project was to implement in C Incidence Matrix data structure representing small simple graphs and a set of operations performed on these graphs in such a way that it is visible in Python as a class inside the simple_graphs module.

## Technologies
* Python 3.10.4
* C
* Windows OS

## Getting Started
* clone the repository  `git clone https://github.com/matibob333/incidenceMatrix.git`  
* to build the module run in command-line `python setup.py build` 
* copy generated file under the path `incidenceMatrix\build\lib.win-amd64-3.10\simple_graphs.cp310-win_amd64.pyd` to the working directory incidenceMatrix
* to check the import run in command-line `python main.py`
